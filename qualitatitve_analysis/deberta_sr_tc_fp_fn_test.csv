These images use a combination of infrared and visible light to increase the contrast between water and land. The highly flood-affected Southern Region only accounts for 13 percent of national production, and the maize harvest in major growing areas of the central and northern regions is expected to exceed 1 million MT. The impacts of the excess moisture are nevertheless seen in the 7 percent decline in maize production and 16 percent drop in cassava production from last year's above-average first-season harvest. To rescue the islanded villages in and around Sethiathoppu, 25 boats from Sonankuppam went for rescue. In Asia, winter cereal crops are being harvested and planting of rice and coarse grain crops has started.
