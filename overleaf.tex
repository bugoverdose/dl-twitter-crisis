\section{Introduction}

% (5 points) How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
% (5 points) Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?

In the event of a disaster, valuable real-time information can be found on social media platforms such as Twitter (now known as X) \cite{TwitterInCrisis}. Time-critical information, such as reports of injured or trapped people, is essential for minimizing casualties. Information about food, water, medical supplies, and shelter is also important for assisting survivors and supporting relief efforts. However, identifying this useful information within the overwhelming stream of online messages is difficult and time-consuming because it is mixed with many irrelevant or emotional reactions that do not contribute to response efforts \cite{BigCrisisData}.

Researchers have therefore built systems that analyze social media during crises. Much of this work has focused on Twitter, using it for early disaster detection, situational awareness, and extracting actionable information \cite{CrisisBenchPaper, TwitterInCrisis}. A major line of research involves tweet classification, enabled by large annotated datasets such as CrisisBench \cite{CrisisBenchPaper}, CrisisLex \cite{Crisislex}, CrisisNLP \cite{CrisisNLP}, and CrisisMMD \cite{CrisisMMD}.

Twitter-based classification studies span a wide range of objectives, but many of them fall under two approaches. The first is informativeness classification, which simply distinguishes useful messages from non-useful ones. This binary classification helps filter noise, but it does not tell responders \textit{what} type of help is needed. The second approach is humanitarian category classification, which assigns tweets to detailed label types (e.g., injuries, missing persons, infrastructure damage). This is more descriptive, but can also create confusion when categories overlap or are too numerous. For example, a tweet describing an injured person trapped beneath collapsed debris fits both ``injured'' and ``infrastructure damage,'' but standard models force only one choice, which can reduce practical usability \cite{CrisisBenchPaper}.

To overcome these limitations, we define a three-class classification task based on how tweets can be used during disaster response. Tweets that require immediate action (e.g., reports of injured people or infrastructure damage) should be classified as the \textbf{time-critical} class. Tweets useful for post-rescue aid (e.g., food, shelter, medical supply needs) fall under the \textbf{support-and-relief} class. Tweets that do not contain any relevant or actionable information (e.g., random online users' reactions to the disaster) are classified as \textbf{non-informative}.

To solve this task, multiple deep learning models with different architectures were trained and fine-tuned to perform this three-way classification. We focus on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transformer-based architectures, as they have previously demonstrated strong performance on crisis datasets \cite{CrisisBenchPaper, Wiegmann2020, Ning}.

If we can successfully train such a classification system, this system will help responders identify urgent information faster, remove distracting content, and allocate resources more effectively. Time-critical posts could assist 119 dispatchers and search-and-rescue teams, while support-and-relief posts could guide donation planning, shelter distribution, and medical supply delivery. In short, this would make real-time crisis information easier to use, which can directly impact human lives.

\subsection{Dataset}

% (5 points) What data did you use? Provide details about your data, specifically choose the most important aspects of your data mentioned here: Datasheets for Datasets (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010). Note that you do not have to choose all of them, just the most relevant.

% motivation: For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.
% composition: What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?

The CrisisBench dataset is used for this project \cite{CrisisBenchPaper}. The dataset was created to serve as a standard evaluation benchmark for crisis tweet classification, addressing the lack of unified and comparable resources in prior work, which aligns well with the goals of our classification task. By consolidating eight pre-existing crisis-related Twitter datasets (e.g., CrisisLex \cite{Crisislex}, CrisisNLP \cite{CrisisNLP}, CrisisMMD \cite{CrisisMMD}), harmonizing labels, and removing duplicates, it enables fair comparison across models and tasks. The primary goal of the dataset is to support robust, reproducible evaluation for both informativeness and humanitarian classification tasks.

For our project, we use the English portion of the CrisisBench dataset for humanitarian classification task, consisting of 87,455 labeled tweets. The CrisisBench dataset defines 11 humanitarian classes by unifying semantically similar labels across multiple source datasets, merging variants with equivalent meaning (e.g., ``Infrastructure damage'' and ``Infrastructure and utilities'' unified as ``Infrastructure and utilities damage'') \cite{CrisisBenchPaper}. For our three-way classification task, these 11 classes were grouped into three higher-level categories as shown in Table \ref{tab:label_mapping}.

All tweets were preprocessed prior to modeling. URLs were removed because they do not provide meaningful semantic information \cite{URLRemoval}. Twitter-specific tokens such as hashtags (e.g., \#PrayForParis), usernames, and retweet markers (e.g., RT @BreakingNews) were removed. We further removed symbols, emoticons, invisible and non-ASCII characters, and punctuation, following the preprocessing strategy described in the CrisisBench paper \cite{CrisisBenchPaper}. All text was lowercased to reduce vocabulary dimensionality while maintaining semantic validity \cite{TextRemoval}. Finally, 110 tweets were discarded because they contained empty strings or duplicated content, resulting in 87,345 remaining samples. Following the original data splits provided by CrisisBench, the final dataset consisted of 61,089 training samples, 8,921 validation samples, and 17,335 test samples.

\textbf{Important: Mention any code repositories (with citations) or other sources that you used, and specifically what changes you made to them for your project. }

\subsection{Models}

In our preprocessing pipeline, we apply tokenization, lowercasing, and removal of URLs and user mentions (@username). We then restrict the dataset to the three selected humanitarian categories used in our study.

We evaluate three distinct model architectures:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A \textbf{TextCNN} model utilizing pre-trained \textbf{GloVe} embeddings to assess its ability to extract local n-gram style features.
    \item A \textbf{custom transformer} model trained from scratch to capture global contextual relationships in the tweets.
    \item A \textbf{pretrained transformer} model that is fine-tuned on our classification task, representing a transfer learning approach leveraging large-scale language pretraining.
\end{enumerate}
By comparing these models, we aim to identify the architecture that offers the best performance for real-time disaster information filtering under our three-label formulation.


\subsection{What's New in Our Approach?}
The main novelty in our approach is not in the individual cleaning steps, but in the re-framing of the CrisisBench classification task itself, moving from a 11-class problem to a triage-centric 3-class problem (time\_critical, support\_and\_relief, non\_informative), which prioritizes immediate operational utility for disaster response.
We anticipated success because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Target Simplification: Reducing the 11 original labels to three relevant classes directly addresses the challenge of building an actionable, real-time triage system. This simplification aligns with the primary goal of surfacing only the most critical humanitarian information during disasters.
    \item Standardized Cleaning: The implemented text-cleaning steps (removal of URLs, hashtags, user mentions, and non-ASCII characters) follow established best practices for natural language processing on noisy social media data. These steps help ensure that the classification models focus on the core semantic content rather than those irrelevant to humanitarian decision-making.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Problems}
\textbf{TODO: ALSO TALK ABOUT PROBLEMS FACED DURING EXPERIMENTATION SUCH AS COMPUTATION LIMITS} \\
We anticipated that the unstructured nature of social media text would lead to noise, and that much of the data would be irrelevant to the disaster response. Directly running the model on the 11 original labels would have likely yielded poor, non-actionable results due to the label complexity and imbalance, which is why the re-mapping was necessary before training. Our very first approach to preprocessing did not work because we failed to account for rows with empty content after cleaning. This led to errors during model training, and we later added logic to remove empty rows after the cleansing process.

\subsection{Performance}
We evaluated the performance of three distinct model architectures:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A TextCNN model utilizing pre-trained GloVe embeddings to assess its ability to extract local n-gram style features.
    \item A custom transformer model trained from scratch to capture global contextual relationships in the tweets.
    \item A pretrained transformer model that is fine-tuned on our classification task, representing a transfer learning approach leveraging large-scale language pretraining.
\end{enumerate}
By comparing these models, we aim to identify the architecture that offers the best performance for real-time disaster information filtering under our three-label formulation.

\section{Experiments and Results}
\textbf{Include explanation of why we chose F1 macro score as the primary metric for tuning}.
\subsection{TextCNN}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0  \linewidth]{cnn_flowchart.png}
    \caption{CNN Architecture}
    \label{fig:cnn_flowchart}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Architecture}
Our TextCNN model follows the architecture proposed in the original CrisisBench paper, adapted for our three-class classification task. TextCNN is particularly well suited for short, noisy text such as tweets because it captures local patterns such as short phrases indicative of urgent events through convolutional filters of different sizes. The model starts with an embedding layer initialized with pre-trained GloVe word embeddings (50-dimensional), followed by multiple parallel 1D convolutional layers with filter sizes of 3, 4, and 5 to capture n-gram features at different scales (refer to Figure \ref{fig:cnn_flowchart}). Each convolutional layer uses 50 filters and applies ReLU activation, followed by max pooling over the sequence length. The outputs from all filter sizes are concatenated and passed through a dropout layer (dropout rate 0.5) before a fully connected layer that produces logits for the three classes (time\_critical, support\_and\_relief, non\_informative). The model uses a vocabulary size of 5000 and a maximum sequence length of 64 tokens.

\subsubsection{Hyperparameter Tuning}
We performed hyperparameter tuning to identify the optimal configuration for our TextCNN model. The hyperparameters that led to the best test F1 score (0.8255) are as follows: filter sizes of (3, 4, 5), 50 filters per filter size, dropout rate of 0.5, batch size of 32, learning rate of $1 \times 10^{-3}$, and training for 5 epochs. We used the Adam optimizer and evaluated our model based on the validation F1 score. We also performed a validation sweep over the number of filters (25, 35, 50, 60, 75, 85, 100). The validation curve (Figure~\ref{fig:cnn_val_curve}) shows that performance increases as the number of filters grows, peaking at 50 filters and declining afterward. This pattern indicates that too many filters lead to overfitting on local n-gram patterns, reducing generalization on noisy social media text.

\subsubsection{Learning and Validation Curves}
We plotted learning curves tracking both loss and macro F1 score across training epochs for both training and validation sets which is shown in Figures \ref{fig:learning_curves} and \ref{fig:cnn_val_curve}. The curves show consistent improvement over 5 epochs, with the validation F1 score reaching 0.8266 at epoch 3. We also generated a validation curve by varying the number of filters while keeping other hyperparameters fixed, which helped us identify the optimal number of filters (50) for our model architecture. This observation reinforces that moderate-capacity CNNs are better suited for short-text classification, where excessively wide convolutional layers tend to memorize local token combinations rather than generalize.
Overall, the learning behavior demonstrates that TextCNN is efficient and capable of capturing the structure necessary for triage-focused disaster tweet classification.

\section{Miscellaneous Information}

The rest of the information in this format template has been adapted from CVPR 2020 and provides guidelines on the lower-level specifications regarding the paper's format.

\subsection{Language}

All manuscripts must be in English.


\subsection{Paper length}
Papers, excluding the references section,
must be no longer than six pages in length. The references section
will not be included in the page count, and there is no limit on the
length of the references section. For example, a paper of six pages
with two pages of references would have a total length of 8 pages.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The ruler}
The \LaTeX\ style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the
version submitted for review.  The ruler is provided in order that
reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without
circumlocution.  If you are preparing a document using a non-\LaTeX\
document preparation system, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to
appear on the final output pages.  The presence or absence of the ruler
should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.  The
camera ready copy should not contain a ruler. (\LaTeX\ users may uncomment
the \verb'\cvprfinalcopy' command in the document preamble.)  Reviewers:
note that the ruler measurements do not align well with lines in the paper
--- this turns out to be very difficult to do well when the paper contains
many figures and equations, and, when done, looks ugly.  Just use fractional
references (e.g.\ this line is $095.5$), although in most cases one would
expect that the approximate location will be adequate.

\subsection{Mathematics}

Please number all of your sections and displayed equations.  It is
important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation.  Just
because you didn't refer to it in the text doesn't mean some future reader
might not need to refer to it.  It is cumbersome to have to use
circumlocutions like ``the equation second from the top of page 3 column
1''.  (Note that the ruler will not be present in the final copy, so is not
an alternative to equation numbers).  All authors will benefit from reading
Mermin's description of how to write mathematics:
\url{http://www.pamitc.org/documents/mermin.pdf}.

Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be
found elsewhere, and refer them to a technical report.  For conference
submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not {\em require} the
reviewer to go to a techreport for further details.  Thus, you may say in
the body of the paper ``further details may be found
in~\cite{Authors14b}''.  Then submit the techreport as additional material.
Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material.

Sometimes your paper is about a problem which you tested using a tool which
is widely known to be restricted to a single institution.  For example,
let's say it's 1969, you have solved a key problem on the Apollo lander,
and you believe that the CVPR70 audience would like to hear about your
solution.  The work is a development of your celebrated 1968 paper entitled
``Zero-g frobnication: How being the only people in the world with access to
the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow at parties'', by Zeus \etal.

You can handle this paper like any other.  Don't write ``We show how to
improve our previous work [Anonymous, 1968].  This time we tested the
algorithm on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review]''.
That would be silly, and would immediately identify the authors. Instead
write the following:
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
   We describe a system for zero-g frobnication.  This
   system is new because it handles the following cases:
   A, B.  Previous systems [Zeus et al. 1968] didn't
   handle case B properly.  Ours handles it by including
   a foo term in the bar integral.

   ...

   The proposed system was integrated with the Apollo
   lunar lander, and went all the way to the moon, don't
   you know.  It displayed the following behaviours
   which show how well we solved cases A and B: ...
\end{quotation}
As you can see, the above text follows standard scientific convention,
reads better than the first version, and does not explicitly name you as
the authors.  A reviewer might think it likely that the new paper was
written by Zeus \etal, but cannot make any decision based on that guess.
He or she would have to be sure that no other authors could have been
contracted to solve problem B.

FAQ\medskip\\
{\bf Q:} Are acknowledgements OK?\\
{\bf A:} No.  Leave them for the final copy.\medskip\\
{\bf Q:} How do I cite my results reported in open challenges?
{\bf A:} To conform with the double blind review policy, you can report results of other challenge participants together with your results in your paper. For your results, however, you should not identify yourself and should not mention your participation in the challenge. Instead present your results referring to the method proposed in your paper and draw conclusions based on the experimental comparison to other results.\medskip\\

Compare the following:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}

 \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
\end{tabular}\\
See The \TeX book, p165.

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a
sentence-ending space. So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.  The provided
\verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'',
shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word.)
However, use it only when there are three or more authors.  Thus, the
following is correct: ``
   Frobnication has been trendy lately.
   It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
   Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...''
because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.  If you use the
\verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods
when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.

For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not
chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors14} to
\cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Authors14}.

\subsection{Formatting your paper}

All text must be in a two-column format. The total allowable width of the
text area is $6\frac78$ inches (17.5 cm) wide by $8\frac78$ inches (22.54
cm) high. Columns are to be $3\frac14$ inches (8.25 cm) wide, with a
$\frac{5}{16}$ inch (0.8 cm) space between them. The main title (on the
first page) should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge of the
page. The second and following pages should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from
the top edge. On all pages, the bottom margin should be 1-1/8 inches (2.86
cm) from the bottom edge of the page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch paper; for A4
paper, approximately 1-5/8 inches (4.13 cm) from the bottom edge of the
page.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Margins and page numbering}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
within a print area 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm)
high.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Type-style and fonts}

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used. If neither is
available on your word processor, please use the font closest in
appearance to Times to which you have access.

MAIN TITLE. Center the title 1-3/8 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of
the first page. The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type.
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and
adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or
prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Leave two blank
lines after the title.

AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title
and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type. This information is to
be followed by two blank lines.

The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format.

MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced. Do NOT use
double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx. 1/6
inch or 0.422 cm). Make sure your text is fully justified---that is,
flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional blank
lines between paragraphs.

Figure and table captions should be 9-point Roman type as in
Figures~\ref{fig:onecol} and~\ref{fig:short}.  Short captions should be centred.

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type.
Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-,
second-, and third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction})
should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, { \bf 1.1. Database elements})
should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one after. If you require a third-order
heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially
capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period
and your text on the same line.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes\footnote {This is what a footnote looks like.  It
often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly.
Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral
observations in
the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).  If you
wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on
which it is referenced. Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times,
single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text,
enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
example~\cite{Authors14}.  Where appropriate, include the name(s) of
editors of referenced books.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
Method & Frobnability \\
\hline\hline
Theirs & Frumpy \\
Yours & Frobbly \\
Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Results.   Ours is better.}
\end{table}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered.  Please ensure that any point you wish to
make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.  Resize fonts in figures
to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths which render
effectively in print.  Many readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic
copy, will choose to print your paper in order to read it.  You cannot
insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can
zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use
\verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the  figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
}

\subsection{Color}

Please refer to the author guidelines on the CVPR 2020 web page for a discussion
of the use of color in your document.
