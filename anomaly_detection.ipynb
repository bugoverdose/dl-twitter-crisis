    "  - Sentiment polarity scores were normalized using MinMax scaling to the [0,1] range. The model’s output was a prediction of subsequent sentiment scores.\n",
    "  - Anomalies were identified when prediction errors exceeded a threshold set at the 95th percentile, highlighting sudden or extreme shifts (changes) in sentiment."
